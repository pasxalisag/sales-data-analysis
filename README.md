# Sales Data Analysis – Business Insights Project

## Business Question
How can sales data be analyzed to identify performance trends, key drivers, and actionable opportunities for revenue growth?

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a retail / e-commerce context to extract meaningful business insights.  
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into clear metrics, trends, and recommendations that can support business decision-making.

The analysis follows a business-oriented approach, similar to what a data analyst would deliver to a sales manager or business owner.

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of transactional sales data including:
- Order dates
- Products and categories
- Sales revenue
- Quantities
- Customer information

The data is analyzed both in its raw form and after cleaning and preprocessing.
